# Random-Forest-and-Logistic-Model-in-R
In this project, I will use two machine learning models, Random Forest and Logistic Regression, to predict heart disease. This is a simple model where I use all available variables to make the prediction. I wonâ€™t delve too deeply into the problem beyond the estimation part.

## Dependencies
Please install the following packages
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(randomForest)
library(tidymodels)
library(ROCR)

## Download the data directly from UCI repository.
